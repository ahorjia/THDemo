# Introduction
The introduction of FP Haskell Center(TM) personal edition means that sharing your projects
with others is now easier than it has ever been before. This project will show you how.

# Publish
First, you need to publish your article. Click the `Publish` icon in the menu bar. It is a curved
arrow pointing out of the page.

This will bring up a commit pane. Add a comment relevant to what's being published, and then
commit it. You will need to do this even if their are no changes from the current head in your
workspace.

# Share
You are done. You can share the URL of your project with others just as it is - post it to reddit,
facebook, or LinkedIn
in your announcement of the project, link to it in a StackOverflow question about the code, letting
people easily try their solutions before answering your question.
